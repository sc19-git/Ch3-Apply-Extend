            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Using descriptive file names for image files in HTML5 is a best practice that supports SEO, enhances accessibility, improves site management and user experience, and aligns with effective content marketing strategies. It can lead to significant benefits for both the website's visibility and its visitors' experience.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
              <p>To change the size of the image, I used the Tools utilities in Preview. I first unlocked the sizing and then changed the width and height.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
                <p>The original image has a size of 2121 x 1414 pixels.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
             <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5" height="333" width="500">
            
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
                  <p>I used compressor.io to compress the image. It went from 27 KB to 7 KB</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The two images were basically identifical except the first image has some blank space after the image's size has been modified.</p>

                <svg width="400" height="233">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40"/>
                </svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I read a tutorial on the website W3 Schools that provided a brief introduction.</p>
